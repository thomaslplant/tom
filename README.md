# Thomas Plant - Bar Project

### Project Overview
For my project I have decided to base it on a bar computer sysetem, incorporating multiple database with multiple tables with at least one relationship between two of them, a front end web application with CRUD functionality using python and flask, as well as providing sufficient testing and overall documentation of the project, including a Trello kanban-style board to track everything that needs to be done and what has already been completed. 

### What I will be using to complete this project
To complete this project to a high standard I will be using various programs, languages and systems and utilise all of the various tools that they offer. Some of which will be:
* Python
* Git
* Visual Studio Code
* Github
* Trello
* Flask
* HTML
* Google Cloud Platform
Many of these programs and systems work symbiotically so it will not only make the project work more efficiently but it will also utilise many of the tools and capabilities available by using them.

### Creating a Virtual Machine
By using a virtaul machine (VM), it allows you to store the code and the system externally, so not only does it save you having to use all your own storage space and RAM, but it also allows you to access it from anywhere so it means that the application will be much more flexible and universal.
### Creating the Databases
For the database I will include a 5 tables:
* Customer
* Bartender
* Drinks
* Payment
* Orders

The Orders table will include the relationships and foreign keys, displaying the specific ID numbers that link to each of the other tables (Customer_ID, Employee_ID, etc.) These tables will also need to have complete CRUD functionality so they will need to be updatable from the web application, meaning there will be many different pages, forms and templates used so that the web page is easily navigated and simple to use.

### Testing
The database will need to be tested thoroughly throughout the process to make sure that the code is reliable and doesn't contain any bugs or faults. I will ensure this by making dedicated test suites to fully test the code to make sure it works and is consistent.

### Planning/Documentation
Over the duration of this project I will plan each of the steps I need to complete before the end by using a Trello kanban board so that it is clearly and simply laid out, as to what I have finished and what I am still yet to complete. By doing this I will ensure that my time is managed well and ensure that everything I need to complete is finished on time. As well as this I shall be uploading all of the saved code onto Github so that it is all readily available to view, and I can see the various changes made along the way by using branching and viewing the various different commits to cleary show my working process.
